## How to submit a CSPEC

We welcome a CSPEC from anyone in the community and encourage you to submit it.  Please follow these guidelines:

- If you a not an employee or contractor of Appcelerator, please make sure you have a valid Contributors License Agreement (CLA) in place before submitting a CSPEC. [You can digitally sign the CLA](http://bit.ly/app_cla) online. Please indicate your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will locate your CLA.  Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for subsequent submissions.
- Please use the [CSPEC template](template.md) when creating your CSPEC repository.  You can copy this file into your repo and rename this file `README.md`.  Make sure you don't assign a CSPEC number when submitting, we will assign one once it is added to the repo officially.
- Your repository must be public and you should name the repository using the following convention: `cspec-<product>-<short_title>`.
- Open a issue in this repository with the URL to your CSPEC repo. Once we validate your CLA, we will update the CSPEC listing with a link to your repo.
- Publicize your CSPEC on various social media and other locations where AppC community congregrate to get input and feedback!

## Best Practices

Here are some best practice guidelines when writing a CSPEC:

- Since you CSPEC is a git repository, you should add test cases, example application code, etc to your proposal. This will help make sure we have good examples of use cases as well as communicate to implementors, quality engineers, documentation team, etc information about what is being implemented.
- When writing a CSPEC, try and provide good examples of the problem and/or use cases to help illustrate the need
- If there are open / unresolved issues, create a section listing them for feedback and resolution
- Link to other resources (documentation, references, etc) and don't always assume the reader knows or can find them. Make it easy for them.
- Make sure the CSPEC is narrowly _focused_ around a specific API, etc. Broad brush features or suggestions will not be helpful or approved for consideration.  The goal for the CSPEC is to provide enough detail to implement, test and document.
